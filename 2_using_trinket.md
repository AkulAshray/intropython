# Using Trinket

[Back to the outline](0_outline.md)

[Trinket](https://trinket.io/python3) lets us run Python code and see the results immediately. It's a good environment to learn in, as you can see a clear link between the code and the output.

### Learning objectives

- [ ] I can run Python code in trinket
- [ ] I can use Python's print command

### Layout

Trinket has two main windows. The left window is for writing code, and the right window shows the output of that code.

Above the windows is the "run" button - a black right-facing arrow. When this button is clicked, Trinket will read the Python code in the left window, and display output on the right.

If the Python code has errors, an error message will display on the right. If the code has no visible output, the right window will remain empty.

### Running code

Type `print("Hello, World!")` into the left-hand window, and run the code. You should see "Hello, World!" appear on the right.

If you didn't, check that you have used all the correct punctuation - Python, and programming in general, has very specific rules.

`print()` is the Python command to display something to the user. What you want to display goes in between the brackets. If it is text, then it needs to have speech marks around it. If it is numbers, you can skip the speech marks.

`print(2)`

Experiment with `print`ing. What can you get it to display? How complicated does it get?

What does `print(2 + 2)` do? What about `print("early" + "bird")`?

### Next steps

Once you are comfortable with the basic layout and controls in Trinket, move on to the [next section](3_operators_and_variables.md) of this module.
