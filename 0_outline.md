# Introduction to Python

In this module, we will start learning how to write computer programs in a language called Python. This way, we can tell our computers to do all the hard work we don't want to do. You'll watch videos about code, read code, and write programs yourself.

### Module goal

By the end of this module, you should have a good grasp of Python fundamentals and be familiar with both reading and writing Python code.

### Learning objectives

- I understand Python fundamentals and key vocabulary
- I can read and understand Python code
- I can write short programs in Python

### Structure

During this module, you will learn the basics of Python syntax and structure, so that you can write your own programs. At the end of the module, you won't be an expert programmer, but you'll have a good starting point from which to develop your skills.

Each section in this repo covers a core concept or technique in Python, with examples and explanations of how it works. Just reading the guide won't be enough to make you comfortable with Python - you'll need to experiment, try out the examples, and write your own programs as well.

You should also watch this [series of videos on Computer Science and programming](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/lecture-videos/index.htm), which will cover programming concepts on a higher level.

Throughout this module, you should experiment with the code you read; try it out, try changing it, break it and then fix it. The best way to understand Python is to use it, to work out the rules through experimentation and active engagement with the language.

At points during this module, there will be challenges - chances to use your understanding to create working programs of increasing complexity. Each challenge has a set of requirements for successful completion, but please view these as minimal, rather than maximal, expectations. Again, the best way to learn programming is to create, build, and experiment.
