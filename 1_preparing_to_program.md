# Preparing to program

[Back to the outline](0_outline.md)

[Python](https://python.org) is a general-purpose, [high-level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language) programming language. It's one of the most popular programming languages in the world, and is widely used by scientists and other people who need an efficient and quickly-understandable way to manipulate large datasets. It's a good language to start programming with because it is designed to be as human-readable and understandable as possible.

### Setup

There are two versions of Python that are widely used - Python 2.7 and Python 3. In this guide, we're going to use Python 3; it's a more modern, efficient version of Python, and it is actively updated and maintained.

Python can be used in various different ways; eventually, you'll probably want to install a copy of Python on your computer so that you can run Python programs directly on your computer. However, in order to get to grips with Python code as fast as possible, we're going to skip that step, and not install anything.

You can run Python code in your browser by using [Trinket](https://trinket.io/python3). This allows us to skip any installation issues, and start programming straight away.

### Next steps

If you've successfully managed to load Trinket in your browser, it's time to head on to the [next section](2_using_trinket.md) of the module.
