# Challenge 2 - indices

Each of these challenges requires you to use the skills you have so far learnt, as well as a couple of new things. They give you the chance to practice core concepts and improve your skills reading/researching code.

This is the second Python challenge.

### Prerequisites

Before completing this challenge, you should be familiar with the following Python topics:

1. variable assignment
2. lists
3. Indices

### New learning

In order to complete this challenge, you will need to research and understand the `len` command and how to access a substring in Python.

### Challenge requirements

Create a program that does the following:

1. Prompts the user to enter three strings
2. Stores the results in variables
3. Creates a list containing the lengths of each string
4. Stores the list in a variable
5. Outputs the list
6. For each string, outputs
    * the length (from the stored list)
    * the first three letters
    * the last three letters

### Guidance

If you get stuck on this challenge, the best option is to look online for help and examples of similar problems. There is also a [walkthrough](../walkthroughs/2.md) you can refer to when nothing else helps.
