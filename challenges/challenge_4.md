# Challenge 4 - conversation

Each of these challenges requires you to use the skills you have so far learnt, as well as a couple of new things. They give you the chance to practice core concepts and improve your skills reading/researching code.

This is the fourth Python challenge.

### Prerequisites

Before completing this challenge, you should be familiar with the following Python topics:

1. variable assignment
2. IF statements

### Challenge requirements

Create a program that does the following:

1. Has a conversation with the user
2. Stores information about the user - name, age, favourite colour, etc.
3. Uses the information to calculate more facts about the user - calculate birth year from age, for example
4. Responds to certain user inputs in different ways, such as agreeing that a specific colour is the best, but disliking others
5. Tells the user everything it has learnt throughout the conversation

Build out the program as much as you wish, creating a conversation with multiple paths and outputs.

### Guidance

If you get stuck on this challenge, the best option is to look online for help and examples of similar problems. There is also a [walkthrough](../walkthroughs/4.md) you can refer to when nothing else helps.
