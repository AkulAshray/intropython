# Challenge 1 - calculations

Each of these challenges requires you to use the skills you have so far learnt, as well as a couple of new things. They give you the chance to practice core concepts and improve your skills reading/researching code.

This is the first Python challenge.

### Prerequisites

Before completing this challenge, you should be familiar with the following Python topics:

1. data types
2. variable assignment
3. using operators

### New learning

In order to complete this challenge, you will need to research and understand the `input` and `int` commands in Python.

### Challenge requirements

Create a program that does the following:

1. Prompts the user to enter two whole numbers
2. Stores each number in a variable
3. Outputs the two numbers added together
4. Outputs the second number subtracted from the first
5. Outputs the two numbers multiplied together
6. Outputs the second number divided by the first

### Guidance

If you get stuck on this challenge, the best option is to look online for help and examples of similar problems. There is also a [walkthrough](../walkthroughs/1.md) you can refer to when nothing else helps.
