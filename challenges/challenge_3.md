# Challenge 3 - countdown

Each of these challenges requires you to use the skills you have so far learnt, as well as a couple of new things. They give you the chance to practice core concepts and improve your skills reading/researching code.

This is the third Python challenge.

### Prerequisites

Before completing this challenge, you should be familiar with the following Python topics:

1. importing
2. FOR loops

### New learning

In order to complete this challenge, you will need to research the Python datetime module.

### Challenge requirements

Create a program that does the following:

1. Prints out "Rocket test: " and the current date and time
2. Prompts the user to enter a positive number
3. Counts down from the entered number to zero, outputting each number
4. Outputs "Blast Off!"
5. Outputs "Test completed: " and the current date and time

### Guidance

If you get stuck on this challenge, the best option is to look online for help and examples of similar problems. There is also a [walkthrough](../walkthroughs/3.md) you can refer to when nothing else helps.
