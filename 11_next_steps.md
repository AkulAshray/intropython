# Next steps

[Back to the outline](0_outline.md)

This module has not covered every part of Python; there is so much more to learn, and so many different things that Python can help you with. Hopefully, this module has provided you with a solid grounding in the fundamentals of Python, a foundation for you to build your knowledge from.

All programs in Python are made by combining the basic elements this module has covered; just using these fundamental tools and structures, you can build almost anything.

### Challenge yourself

One of the best ways to improve your programming ability is to build things. All of the different concepts we have covered can be combined to make almost anything. Pick a small project to start with, and try and program a solution. You'll learn a huge amount, even when you get stuck.

Here are some suggested projects you could use to build your skills:

* A calculator that can add, divide, multiply, or subtract based on user input.

* A program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

* A mastermind game, in which the user has ten chances to guess a four-digit number. After each guess, the computer prints out the number of correct digits in the right places, and the number of correct digits in the wrong places.

* A text adventure game with several possible paths and endings, in the style of [Zork](http://textadventures.co.uk/games/view/5zyoqrsugeopel3ffhz_vq/zork).
